# Training Facilitator Guide

## Purpose of the training material
This 2-hour long unit provides trainers with the core skills and knowledge to teach the nuances of licensing research outputs. After completing the unit, the trainer will be able to reflect on how to tailor the content to their local environment, and have more knowledge about how and when to apply licenses throughout a project, while complying with funders, institutional requirements and the research discipline/aims of the project.

Licensing is a complex topic, **hence we present a very thorough slide deck covering many aspects of licensing. As this learning path thus has a wealth of slides, and  the instructor should choose which slides best suit a given occasion.**  We leave this slimming down of the content at the discretion of the instructor, and the context and target group in which they are teaching.

## Conducting the training and requirements to the instructor(s)
The training concept is facilitated, discussion led, either online or physical. The material is designed for participants with a basic knowledge of licensing but have the need to discuss with peers and reflect over licensing issues. Accordingly, the trainer needs the ability to be a facilitator and engage participants in discussions. It is not expected the trainer has all the answers and we strongly recommend a "maker approach" to traing, where knowledge and learning are created together.

## Lesson plan

| Time | Topic             | Key Messages     | Prompts    | Resources    |
|-----------|-------------------| -----------------|------------|--------------|
| 00:00-00:10| Introduction & Housekeeping  |Introduce trainers, learning objectives, code of content, present schedule, learning activities (including peer review concept) and certification and expectations for the session |    |Slide 1 - 4    |
| 00:10-00:20  | Ice-breaking  | Trainers get to know each other and find a course partner    | Breakout room discussions of an even number, eg. 4 or 6 persons    |Slide 5    |
| 00:20-00:30  | Why you shouldn't license research data      | Advocate for the advantages of licensing    | This topic will cover the hypotheticals which the trainees can discuss with the instructor    |Slide 6 - 10    |
| 00:30-00:40  | Learning Activity 1 |  Scenario advising a researcher against licensing data| Discuss and argue for the benefits of licensing   |Slide 11 and [Learning Activity 1](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Open-Licenses-data-code-and-software/blob/main/resources/Learning%20Unit/Activities/activity_details_template.md)     |
| 00:40-00:45 | Break      | 
| 00:45-65:00 | What to consider before applying licenses to research output  | Challenges for data stewards and researchers when sharing and licensing research outputs     | Encourage discussion of disciplinary and/or organisational differences    |Slide 12 - 35 and digital white board or post-its to capture discussion |
| 65:00-75:00  |Learning Activity 2  | Research is often influenced by many different stakeholders, so it is tricky to choose the right license | Assessing a test case: How can you share and license the research outputs? Think for yourself and write down your considerations in the learning activity sheet (3 minutes). Then collect the answers in plenum (7 minutes)  |Slide 36 and [Learning Activity 2](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Open-Licenses-data-code-and-software/blob/main/resources/Learning%20Unit/Activities/activity_details_template.md)     |
| 75:00-95:00  | How to apply licenses to research output   | Tools and guides to choose the correct licenses | Remember that different institutions may have policies regulating the ability for a researcher to  license research data.   |Slide 38 - 52|
| 95:00-105:00  |Learning Activity 3     |    |    |Slide 53 and [Learning Activity 3](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Open-Licenses-data-code-and-software/blob/main/resources/Learning%20Unit/Activities/activity_details_template.md)     |
| 105:00-115:00 | Summing up the workshop and homework  |  * Repeat the participants obligation to conduct peer review of their course partners learning sheet. * Ensure that all participants have a course partner and have exchanged contact information.  * Ensure that all participants understand that they have to send in their completed learning activity sheets within seven working days.  * Ensure everyone knows where to send the completed learning sheets.   |Reflection, Point to where the participants can learn more and put the link to the Evaluation form in the chat  |Slide 54 - 55|
