# Training Facilitator Guide

## Purpose of the training material
This 2-hour long unit provides trainers with the core skills and knowledge to teach the nuances of licensing research outputs. After completing the unit, the trainer will be able to reflect on how to tailor the content to their local environment, and have more knowledge about how and when to apply licenses throughout a project, while complying with funders, institutional requirements and the research discipline/aims of the project.

Licensing is a complex topic, **hence we present a very thorough slide deck covering many aspects of licensing. As this learning path thus has a wealth of slides, and  the instructor should choose which slides best suit a given occasion.**  We leave this slimming down of the content at the discretion of the instructor, and the context and target group in which they are teaching.

## Conducting the training and requirements to the instructor(s)
The training concept is facilitated, discussion led, either online or physical. The material is designed for participants with a basic knowledge of licensing but have the need to discuss with peers and reflect over licensing issues. Accordingly, the trainer needs the ability to be a facilitator and engage participants in discussions. It is not expected the trainer has all the answers and we strongly recommend a "maker approach" to traing, where knowledge and learning are created together.

## Reflection exercise
We encourage the participants to reflect individually over the following points, for about 3 mins. The instructor can then invite a few participants to share their thoughts, but it is not the intention of the reflection exercise to hear everyones’ experiences. Rather the reflection is to encourage thought about further action the individual will take moving forward.

The instructor introduces the reflection points, reading them out loud from slide 55. The first question enourages the participant to think about what they have learned during the session. The second question concerns the particpants AHA! moment and links to questions three and four. In question three, the participants thinks about something discussed during the training session they need to consider further while question 4 leads to action - what will they do differently from now on?

- What were you happy about learning today? (YES!)
- Which good points are you taking with you? (AHA!)
- A challenge or dilemma you need to consider? (Hmm)
- What will you do differently  from now  on? (Go do!)


# Instructor notes for the three topics taught in the learning unit


## Unit 1: Why you shouldn’t license your research output
To introduce the topic of licensing, in this unit we start by asking the students why they should NOT license their data. In this way, they can share any experiences they may have had with people who were reluctant to use licenses for research data. Based on these shared experiences, the instructor can then begin to teach and discuss the advantages of and hesitations towards licensing data in contexts relevant for the learners.

**Key takeaways:**
- Applying a licence is of crucial importance for disseminating a research product. 
- The choosing to apply a license is a determinant stage in the process of diffusing a research product. This choice has concrete consequences and should not be taken lightly.
- When faced with a reluctance to use a license, it is necessary to insist that it is not a constraint but a benefit for the researcher himself and for his scientific community (protection of one’s right, more citations, more re-use).


## Instructor notes unit 1

**Slides 2-4:** Introduction and housekeeping. These slides lay out the overview of the learning path, some ground rules, learning objectives and an overview of what the data steward can expect from this 2 hour learning path. These 10 minutes can be used to introduce trainers and helpers, share the agenda and learning objectives (as shown on the slides). Instructors can reiterate that this an intermediate learning path aimed at data stewards who may know some basics about licensing, and are keen to develop the knowledge further.

**Slide 5:** Icebreaker. These 10 minutes can be used for participants to introduce themselves to one another using the prompts on the slides. For an in-person training, this could be done in small breakout groups. If the training is virtual, it could also be done on a collective document (google doc/hackMD) to enable participation.
 
**Slide 6-7:** A glossary of common terms intended an a handout

**Slide 8-9:** This unit is titled ‘Why you shouldn’t license your research output’ and is intended to be provocative. The aim is for the instructor to use common scenarios encountered by data stewards where researchers may be hesitant to apply licenses, and for the instructor to advocate for license use through addressing each scenario in turn. 

**Slides 10-11:** These slides cover the aforementioned scenarios, through imagining a hypothetical conversation between a data steward and a researcher. Each scenario/reason not to license has a counter or follow up on how licensing can help and why it is important. Instructors are encouraged to ask data stewards to reflect on similar conversations they may have had and how arguments used by the (fictional) data steward in the slides could help address some of the questions.

**Slide 12:** The instructor concludes the unit by stating the takeaways. The instructor is free to develop these two elements according to the time remaining. 

**Slide 13:** This learning activity uses two question prompts to engage participants in a discussion about how they would advocate for license use among researchers who were reluctant to use licenses. Participants can choose from the two scenarios. It is possible that there is not enough time in the learning path to discuss each breakout group or participant response in detail, in this case participants will be asked to share reflections from the learning activity after the session. 



## Unit 2: What to consider before applying licenses to research outputs
This unit addresses challenges for data stewards and researchers when sharing and licensing research outputs. These challenges arise in connection with requirements from external stakeholders like funders and publishers, ethical or legal obligations, and in relation to intellectual property rights and commercialization. The learner is made aware of factors that can negatively impact the novelty of research outputs and make sharing and licensing research data, software and code unattractive. Finally, mitigation strategies are introduced that a data steward can employ to adhere to external requirements and obligations, while at the same time protecting researchers’ rights to their data.

**Key takeaways:**
- Before applying licenses to research outputs like data, code, or software, you have to balance many different factors like stakeholder requirements, ethical or legal obligations, regulations, policies, and rights. 
- Mitigation strategies can help to navigate these partially contradicting requirements and maintain the ability to share and license research outputs.
- You have to be aware of the benefits and risks of choosing one licensing pathway over another.

## Instructor notes unit 2

The aim of this unit is to encourage a discussion of the different requirements, policies and regulation that can influence the sharing and licensing of research outputs. The unit begins with a presentation of the research life cycle and how licences may influence a project’s dissemination strategy. Then, the unit introduces funder and journal requirements, ethical concerns, personal data and contractual obligations that research outputs may be subject to. Finally, the unit explores how licensing may raise concerns about maintaining the novelty of licensed data (software and code), commercialisation, copyright infringement, dual use and rights to assign licenses.
Slides 17 through 36 present all the factors influencing the sharing and licensing of research outputs one by one. Each factor is presented on two slides. The first slide introduces the factor and gives a concrete example of where a researcher – or you as a data steward – may come across a given requirement (something you should comply with) or an expectation (something you can comply with). The second slide expands on the concrete example and points to potential mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies are ways of balancing the given requirements or expectations with other potentially contradicting requirements or expectations and thereby maintain your ability to share and license research outputs. Assigning a license is a capability that you must have, and the mitigation strategies are ways to have that capability at the time of licensing.

*Remember: Sharing non-licensed research outputs makes their reuse almost impossible - or will at least prevent their correct attribution and citation.*

**General teaching hint for this unit:** 
You do not have to go through all the slides one by one. Think about your audience and then choose the factors that are most relevant for them.

**Slide 15:** Licensing is part of good planning practice (understood as preparation before the project). But as research changes along the way, there is a continuous need to focus on change management and what that means for the ability to license research outputs. Remember; a plan only survives the first meeting with reality.
*Teaching hint: You can use this slide either as a talking primer for yourself (“lecturing”) or you can use it as a discussion primer to explore together with the learners where licences play a role in the research life cycle. It could be particularly interesting to discuss disciplinary and/or organisational differences and opportunities.*

**Slide 16:** This slide provides an overview of all the factors influencing the decision of whether to share a research output (or not) and how to license it. The image of the balance is meant to visualise that sharing outputs and choosing an appropriate license is a balancing act, where many different factors like stakeholder requirements, ethical or legal obligations, regulations, policies, and rights have to be balanced in order to make the right decision. Sometimes these factors may pull into different directions or even plainly contradict one another, e.g. a journal requiring to publish data openly, when the data are personal. Or a funder requiring early data sharing, while the researcher would not want to risk not being able to publish novel findings in a prestigious journal.

**Slide 17+18 (funders):** Funders often require that research outputs are made openly available or at least made FAIR, in order to ensure a high accessibility and an equally high reusability. The example on slide 17 is clipped from Horizon Europe’s Annotated Grant Agreement (AGA) and presents a number of requirements for open and FAIR data. These are explained in more detail in the first two bullets on slide 18. Here, it is important to note that the licensing requirements are known early on in the process (in general, already during the grant application phase). The recommended mitigation strategies are therefore that both the FAIRification and the licensing of research outputs should be negotiated between project partners early on and documented in writing, e.g. in a data management plan (DMP).
Slide 19-20 (journals): A lot of journals have an expectation that a researcher will share research outputs like data and code under a given license. These expectations are usually documented in the journals’ data policies. You can find them by looking for “Open Data”, “FAIR data”, “Data Policy” or “Data Availability Statement” in the “Information for Authors” on the journal or publisher website. The researcher and their collaborators have to investigate this as soon as possible and then act accordingly. If a journal requires you, for instance, to publish data with a CC-BY 4.0 license, you cannot include CC-BY-SA 4.0-licensed data in your dataset.

**Slide 21-22 (ethical):** Ethical concerns relate often to data sharing, not to the ability to license. Slide 22 lists a number of research subjects, whose rights have to be protected – and these are not only human participants, but also animals, plants and even entire ecosystems. You live up with the principles of ethical research conduct by assessing the potential impact of your research before you even start interacting with your research subjects and objects; by choosing only a subset (potentially de-identified) for publication and by obtaining proper informed consent that includes data sharing.

**Slide 23-24 (personal data):** Personal data are difficult to manage - and even harder to share and license. This is due to data privacy regulations enforced by e.g. GDPR in Europe and related national legislation. 

**Slide 25-26 (contractual):** If you collect, buy, or produce data in a confidential environment (or under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), or if you produce code under contractual obligations, you may be restricted in the ability to share and license. The sooner you match your sharing and licensing aspirations with your contractual obligations, the sooner you can apply the mitigation strategies.

**Slide 27-28 (novelty of findings):** Although more and more journals require sharing and licensing data and/or code, there is a risk in doing this too soon. Openly sharing and licensing the data and/or code for others may jeopardize the novelty of your findings, if somebody else uses the data and/or code to reach the same results before you.

**Slide 29-30 (commercialization):** Researchers are obliged through their job contract with the university to report novel findings in order to explore potential commercial spinouts, patents or the like. This obligation can be given by law, but can sometimes also be required by funders. It is best practice to seek advice early on in the process, at any rate before sharing and/or licensing data and/or code, to investigate if this hinders the ability to commercialize.

**Slide 31-32 (copyright/license infringement):** If you share and license something you did not create, e.g. by combining it with your own data and/or code, you may violate the copyright of others or the license of the original material. Let’s go through the three examples on slide 31: (1) Bloomberg: If you buy data from a commercial data provider, the data usually underlie quite restrictive usage rights agreements that you signed in the purchase process, e.g. you cannot redistribute and/or waiver the original rights to the data and/or code. (2) CC BY-NC-ND box: This can also be a problem, if you reuse other peoples’ publicly available work that is licensed in a specific way. A work licensed CC BY-NC-ND, for instance, cannot be reused in a commercial context (NC = non-commercial) and you are not allowed to change the work in any way (ND = no derivatives). (3) Pizza: The last example is the case of a citizen science project, where citizens are invited to participate and contribute ideas. When volunteers or citizen scientists then produce drawings of their design ideas, these have to be considered original works that are subject to copyright. Does the research project have the ability to assign a license to this work as part of the dissemination of their research? The answer is no, but this could be achieved either by written agreement, or by having the citizen scientists license their work in the first place (see Hansen et al. 2021 for details).

**Slide 33-34 (dual use):** So-called “dual use” concerns the misuse of research data and/or for undesired military or civil applications. Data and code that can be (mis)used for military purposes must not be shared and/or licensed. This is a legal requirement.

**Slide 35-36 (right to assign a license):** The ability for a researcher and/or data steward to waiver rights to data and/or code cannot be taken for granted. There might be restrictions or procedures (as illustrated by the Bristol example) that limits the ability, or national legislation (as illustrated by the French example) that enables the creators of data and/or code to license it without having an explicit permit. On the backdrop of the national legislation in France, research projects are free to choose whether or not to license their research data, without being obliged to do so. As a matter of best practice, however, it would still be useful to continue using re-use licenses, as they clearly inform re-users of the extent of their rights and obligations.

**Slide 37 (summing up, identical to slide ##):** This slide provides an overview of all the factors influencing the decision of whether to share a research output (or not) and how to license it. The image of the balance is meant to visualise that sharing outputs and choosing an appropriate license is a balancing act, where many different factors like stakeholder requirements, ethical or legal obligations, regulations, policies, and rights have to be balanced in order to make the right decision. Sometimes these factors may pull into different directions or even plainly contradict one another, e.g. a journal requiring to publish data openly, when the data are personal. Or a funder requiring early data sharing, while the researcher would not want to risk not being able to publish novel findings in a prestigious journal.

## Unit 3: practical application of licenses to (FAIR) research output
Following on from the abstract discussion and after checking the ability to license research outputs in unit 2, this third unit is dedicated to the concrete process of choosing the appropriate license. It presents the learner with practical tools and guides. At first, there is a global introduction with an overview of different licenses that are available to license data, software or code. Then, a step-by-step guide to license research output is suggested :
- Step 1 (to be prepared to award a license): identify the holder of the copyright
- Step 2 (when awarding a license): how to chose the perfect license for your research output and what considerations should be taken into account when doing it. Some tools are suggested that can help the student.
- Step 3 (after awarding a license): the work is not over quite yet, some things need to be checked once the license is awarded : the trainer briefly addresses the importance of human and machine readability and licensing metadata.

**Key takeaways:**
- The research product are not equal in legal terms and require specific licenses to be used. There are many different licenses available, each one having its own characteristics. For each project, you need to identify the nature of the product to be opened, according to which specific licenses are applicable

- There are some free online tools that can guide you towards finding the perfect license considering your own needs and conditions.

- Even when you have found the license that perfectly match your needs, your work is not over just yet. You still have to check its readability :
 - for humans : how your choice of license is expressed when landing on your research output page;
 - for machines : for interoperability.
