# Unit Lesson Plan Template

## Unit Name

Aim/Goal of unit

### Location
- is it going to be online or physical
- if physical any special room type should be noted (e.g. classroom, IT lab, ...)

### Total duration

### Number of attendees
- important to know the max group size
- can be a number range (e.g. 20-30)

### Learning objectives
- list the learning objectives that are to be achieved
- learning objectives should be devised using the verbs from the Bloom's Taxonomy
- learning objectives should be SMART

### Plan
| Time | Topic             | Key Messages     | Prompts    | Resources    |
|-----------|-------------------| -----------------|------------|--------------|
| 00:00-00:10| Introduction & Housekeeping  |Introduce trainers, learning objectives, code of content, present schedule, learning activities (including peer review concept) and certification and expectations for the session |    |Slide 1 - 4    |
| 00:10-00:20  | Ice-breaking  | Trainers get to know each other and find a course partner    | Breakout room discussions of an even number, eg. 4 or 6 persons    |Slide 5    |
| 00:20-00:30  | Why you shouldn't license research data      | Advocate for the advantages of licensing    | This topic will cover the hypotheticals which the trainees can discuss with the instructor    |Slide 6 - 10    |
| 00:30-00:40  | Learning Activity 1 |  Scenario advising a researcher against licensing data| Discuss and argue for the benefits of licensing   |Slide 11 and [Learning Activity 1](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Open-Licenses-data-code-and-software/blob/main/resources/Learning%20Unit/Activities/activity_details_template.md)     |
| 00:40-00:45 | Break      | 
| 00:45-65:00 | What to consider before applying licenses to research output  | Challenges for data stewards and researchers when sharing and licensing research outputs     | Encourage discussion of disciplinary and/or organisational differences    |Slide 12 - 35 and digital white board or post-its to capture discussion |
| 65:00-75:00  | Learning Activity 2  | Research is often influenced by many different stakeholders, so it is tricky to choose the right license | Assessing a test case: How can you share and license the research outputs? Think for yourself and write down your considerations in the learning activity sheet (3 minutes). Then collect the answers in plenum (7 minutes)  |Slide 36 and [Learning Activity 2](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Open-Licenses-data-code-and-software/blob/main/resources/Learning%20Unit/Activities/activity_details_template.md)     |
| 75:00-95:00  | How to apply licenses to research output   | Tools and guides to choose the correct licenses | Remember that different institutions may have policies regulating the ability for a researcher to  license research data.   |Slide 38 - 52|
| 95:00-105:00  | Learning Activity 3     |    |    |Slide 53 and [Learning Activity 3](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Open-Licenses-data-code-and-software/blob/main/resources/Learning%20Unit/Activities/activity_details_template.md)     |
| 105:00-115:00 | Summing up the workshop and homework  |  Repeat the participants obligation to conduct peer review of their course partners learning sheet. Ensure that all participants have a course partner and have exchanged contact information.                       Ensure that all participants understand that they have to send in their completed learning activity sheets within seven working days.  Ensure everyone knows where to send the completed learning sheets.   |Reflection exercise (explained below).  |Slide 54 - 56|
| 115:00-120:00 | Wrapping up    |  Point to where the participants can learn more, show the references on the slides |  Put the link to  evaluation form in the chat   |Slide 57 - 60   |


Note: If the training is relying heavily on presentations then another option for the plan layout is to provided in a slide by slide using slide thumbnails in the topic column. In this case each row in the table should refer to a separate slide in the presentation.


### Assessment
- what, how, when
- is it going to be formative (throughout) or summative (in the end)
- results how and when

### Certificate or Badge
- micro-credentials for the unit
- if certificate or badge is issued then explain how it can be gained

### Reflection
- how did it go
- highlights: what went great
- improvement points: what went wrong

### Comments
- any additional comments from external parties acting as co-creators
